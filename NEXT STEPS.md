#Next Steps

### fix the issue of binary classification chart and predictions - data side done, need to run model and update visuals

#9 Make an architecture diagram of the project

# 10 Make a high score list of the best predictions, rank off $ made (% return) if followed during test period.
Regression should rank off MAPE - Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Binary Classification should rank off F1 score

#13 potentially switch to call lambdas directly (will need to add Flask Limiter to imports)

#14 add a feature to the home page that shows the top 5 predictions
