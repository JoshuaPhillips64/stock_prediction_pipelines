#Next Steps


#8 Apply the certificate to the EC2 instance, and add the domain name to the instance, figure out the NGINX configuration.

#9 Make an architecture diagram of the project

# 10 Make a high score list of the best predictions, rank off $ made (% return) if followed during test period.

# 11 make the generate button not be able to be clicked until the input is valid

# 12 put something to stop bots from using the generate button (RECAPTCHA on forms.py) and contact form

#13 potentially switch to call lambdas directly (will need to add Flask Limiter to imports)

#14 add a feature to the home page that shows the top 5 most recent predictions
