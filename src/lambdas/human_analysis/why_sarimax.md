# SARIMAX Model for Stock Return Prediction - Summary

I use the **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX)** model to predict stock returns 30 days into the future. The choice of SARIMAX stems from a critical evaluation of the data and objectives, making it an ideal fit for this financial time series problem.

1. **Understanding SARIMAX:**
   - **SARIMAX** builds on the ARIMA model, adding seasonality and external variables (exogenous regressors) that may influence stock returns. It accounts for autocorrelation, seasonality, and exogenous factors while handling non-stationary data.

2. **Suitability of SARIMAX:**
   - **Stock Returns vs. Prices:** Stock returns are more stationary and easier to model.
   - **Autoregressive Nature:** SARIMAX captures the autocorrelation in stock returns.
   - **Exogenous Variables:** Variables like technical indicators can be included without future data leakage.
   - **Seasonality:** Though daily data may lack strong seasonality, SARIMAX is flexible enough to handle it if needed.
   - **Interpretability:** SARIMAX parameters and diagnostics offer clarity in understanding the results.

3. **Comparison with Other Models:**
   - **Prophet:** Less suitable due to its dependence on future regressors and its univariate nature.
   - **Random Forest:** Lacks temporal awareness and interpretability in time series forecasting.
   - **LSTM:** Requires too much data and is prone to overfitting in smaller datasets.
   - **GARCH:** Better suited for volatility modeling, not stock returns.
   - **ARIMA:** SARIMAX is more flexible due to the inclusion of exogenous variables.

4. **Critical Evaluation of SARIMAX:**
   - **Advantages:** Suitable for small datasets, avoids data leakage, interpretable, and computationally efficient.
   - **Limitations:** Linear assumptions and risk of overfitting. Mitigation strategies include model diagnostics and statistical tests.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - **Why SARIMAX?** It balances model complexity, dataset size, and objectives by incorporating exogenous variables without introducing biases. It's a robust and efficient model widely accepted in financial time series forecasting.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- SARIMAX is an appropriate model for time series forecasting, especially with exogenous variables.
- It avoids overfitting and data leakage, adhering to best practices in financial forecasting.
- The model is computationally efficient and interpretable, making it suitable for predicting stock returns in this context.
